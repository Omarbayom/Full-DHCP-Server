3. [ ]  Extend Server features
3. [ ]  Server Optimization
-----
### Project Planning and Design
Define the project scope, goals, and functionalities. Create a detailed design document 
outlining the architecture, components, and communication protocols. 

#### Steps
- Define user authentication mechanisms. 
- Outline the overall project scope, including key functionalities. 
- Design the system architecture, specifying components and their interactions. 
- Demonstrate communication/message protocols according to the RFC.

### Basic Client-Server Setup
Implement the foundational elements of the system, including basic client-server 
communication using Python and sockets. 

#### Steps 
- Implement a basic server application capable of handling multiple client connections. 
- Establish a TCP connection for user authentication (if required). 
- Implement a simple command-line interface showing the server status. 

### Extend Server features
extend the developed server agent with RFC features and error codes.


### Server Optimization
Enhance the developed agent by optimizing communication protocols for better 
performance according to the RFC.
#### Steps 
- Optimize communication protocols based on different scenarios (e.g., TCP for reliability, UDP 
for real-time interactions).
- Conduct performance testing to evaluate the scalability of the system. 
- Finalize the user interface, considering usability and user experience.

## Backlog of Requirements and User Stories are according to the RFC. 
RFCs can be found [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/))

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

- **RFC 2131**: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) defines DHCP, a protocol used to automate 
the assignment of IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other network parameters. It allows 
devices on a network to request configuration information from a DHCP server dynamically.

- **RFC 2132**: DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions. This RFC details additional options that 
can be used with DHCP, extending the base protocol to support various configuration parameters 
such as subnet masks, routers, and domain names.
